# BattleShips LocalNetwork
 Online game that can be played by 2 players on local network


Step 1:
 - Run the server script

Step 2:
 - Run the client by maximum 2 players

Step 3:
 - Play the game and when it ends, please make sure that both players click back to main menu before connecting again as there is only 1 bug that I was not able to fix but since the game is made to be played only locally you can sync with your friend about that.
